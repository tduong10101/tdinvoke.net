Hi There!

Welcome to my blog, my name is Terry Duong. I'm a monitoring engineer with a very **strong** interest in AWS. I love automation and writing small scripts to solve everyday problems. This blog is my first 'serverless' project and will be where I post on my journey in the IT world (and maybe some random tech I might pick up on the way). There'll be alot to learn/write about. Thank you for visiting! Stay wonder, keep the curiosity alive.

Regards,

TD
