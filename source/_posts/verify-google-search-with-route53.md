Just recently got this site on google search, totally forgot about it when I created the site.  
The process is quite easy. Follow the instructions on this [link](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6149686?hl=en) should cover the task.  
Might take from 10 minutes to 5 hours for the TXT record to populate, so be patient!
